# Golf Series Backend - Cursor Rules

## Project Overview
This is a Golf Series management backend system built with TypeScript and Bun.js, following clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns.

## Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: Bun.js (>=1.0.0)
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Web Framework**: Hono (for HTTP server and routing)
- **Database**: SQLite with Bun's built-in SQLite library, simple migration lib built-in
- **Testing**: Bun's built-in test runner
- **Package Manager**: Bun

## Architecture & Code Structure

### 1. Layered Architecture
The project follows a clean 3-layer architecture:

\`\`\`
src/
├── api/           # HTTP layer - API endpoints and request/response handling
├── services/      # Business logic layer - domain services
├── database/      # Data access layer - migrations, schema, DB utilities
├── types/         # Type definitions and DTOs
├── app.ts         # Application setup and routing
└── server.ts      # Server entry point
\`\`\`

### 2. API Layer (`src/api/`)
- **Purpose**: HTTP request/response handling, validation, error handling
- **Pattern**: Factory functions that create API handlers (e.g., `createCoursesApi()`)
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - Parse request bodies and parameters
  - Call appropriate service methods
  - Handle errors and return proper HTTP status codes
  - Return JSON responses with correct Content-Type headers
- **Error Handling**: Always wrap service calls in try-catch, return 400 for validation errors, 404 for not found, 500 for unexpected errors

### 3. Service Layer (`src/services/`)
- **Purpose**: Business logic and domain operations
- **Pattern**: Classes that encapsulate domain logic (e.g., `CourseService`, `CompetitionService`)
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Input validation and business rule enforcement
  - Database operations through direct SQL queries
  - Data transformation and calculations
  - Cross-entity operations and relationships
- **Database Access**: Services directly use `Database` from `bun:sqlite` with prepared statements

### 4. Database Layer (`src/database/`)
- **Migration System**: Custom migration classes extending base `Migration` class
- **Schema**: Defined through migration files, not ORM models
- **Tables**: courses, teams, competitions, tee_times, participants, series
- **Key Features**: Foreign key constraints enabled, timestamps on all entities

## Database Management

### Schema Design
- **Primary Keys**: Auto-incrementing integers
- **Timestamps**: `created_at` and `updated_at` on all entities
- **Foreign Keys**: Enforced with cascading behavior
- **JSON Fields**: Used for scores (arrays) and course pars

### Migration Pattern
1. Create new migration class in `src/database/migrations/`
2. Extend base `Migration` class
3. Implement `up()` and `down()` methods
4. Use helper methods like `columnExists()` for conditional changes
5. Migrations are tracked in `migrations` table

### Database Operations
- Use prepared statements for all queries
- Enable foreign keys with `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`
- Handle constraint violations gracefully
- Use transactions for multi-step operations

## Testing Strategy

### Test Structure
\`\`\`
tests/
├── *.test.ts         # Feature-specific test files
├── test-helpers.ts   # Shared testing utilities
└── test-server.ts    # Test server management
\`\`\`

### Testing Patterns
1. **Setup/Teardown**: Use `beforeEach`/`afterEach` with in-memory database
2. **Test Database**: Create fresh database for each test file
3. **API Testing**: Use `makeRequest` helper for HTTP calls
4. **Assertions**: Use `expectJsonResponse` and `expectErrorResponse` helpers
5. **Test Organization**: Group tests by HTTP method and endpoint

### Test Requirements
- **Coverage**: Test all CRUD operations for each entity
- **Validation**: Test all input validation scenarios
- **Error Cases**: Test 404, 400, and constraint violation scenarios
- **Relationships**: Test foreign key constraints and cascading behavior
- **Business Logic**: Test calculations (leaderboards, scoring, etc.)

## Key Business Rules

### Golf Domain Rules
- **Courses**: Maximum 18 holes, pars between 3-6
- **Competitions**: Must have valid YYYY-MM-DD date format
- **Participants**: Belong to tee times, have scores as number arrays
- **Leaderboard**: Calculated relative to par across all holes played

### Data Validation
- **Required Fields**: Name fields cannot be empty/whitespace
- **Unique Constraints**: Team names, series names must be unique
- **Foreign Keys**: Always validate referenced entities exist
- **Dates**: Use ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) for competition dates

## Development Guidelines

### When Adding New Features
1. **API Layer**: Create factory function returning handlers object
2. **Service Layer**: Create service class with domain methods
3. **Types**: Define DTOs for create/update operations
4. **Database**: Add migration if schema changes needed
5. **Tests**: Write comprehensive test suite covering all scenarios
6. **Routes**: Add routes to `app.ts` with proper HTTP methods

### When Modifying Existing Code
1. **Update Services**: Modify business logic in service layer
2. **Update Tests**: Ensure all existing tests pass and add new test cases
3. **Update Types**: Modify DTOs if request/response structure changes
4. **Database Changes**: Create new migration if schema modifications needed

### Error Handling Standards
- Service layer throws descriptive Error objects
- API layer catches and maps to appropriate HTTP status codes
- Always return JSON error responses with `{ error: "message" }` format
- Use specific error messages for validation failures

### Code Quality Standards
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer prepared statements over string concatenation
- Use descriptive variable names and function names
- Keep API handlers thin - delegate to services
- Write self-documenting code with clear intent

### Testing Requirements for Changes
- **New Features**: Must include full test coverage
- **Bug Fixes**: Add regression test before fixing
- **API Changes**: Test all HTTP methods and status codes
- **Business Logic**: Test edge cases and validation rules
- **Database Changes**: Test constraints and relationships

Remember: Every code change should be accompanied by corresponding test updates to maintain the high test coverage and ensure system reliability.

## Prompt interaction
When changing or updating APIs you should print routes and body format at the end of prompts so I know the API

There is a frontend codebase in the /frontend directory. You should never update those files.

# Golf Tournament & Scoring Platform - Product Specification

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the product specification for a comprehensive digital golf scoring platform that supports various tournament formats, series, tours, and adhoc games. The platform serves both competitive organized golf (team series, individual tours) and casual play, with real-time scoring, leaderboards, and statistics.

### Core Value Proposition
- Digital scoring for all golf formats (stroke play, stableford, match play, etc.)
- Support for team series, individual tours, and standalone competitions
- Real-time leaderboards and results
- Mobile-first scoring interface
- Comprehensive statistics and historical data

### Target Users
1. **Golf Clubs & Organizations** - Running official series and tours
2. **Golf Groups & Friends** - Organizing casual series, tours, or one-off competitions
3. **Individual Players** - Participating in events and tracking personal statistics

## 2. User Types & Access Levels

### 2.1 Registered Users
- **Players**: Can join competitions, enter scores, view statistics
- **Admins**: Can create/manage series, tours, competitions, and teams
- **Player-Admins**: Have both player and admin capabilities
- Authentication via email/password
- Profile management with handicap, home club, etc.

### 2.2 Temporary Token Users
- Access specific competitions via unique token/code
- Limited to scoring and viewing for that specific event
- No account required
- Token expires after competition ends
- Ideal for guest players or one-time participants

### 2.3 Anonymous Users
- Browse public series, tours, and competitions
- View leaderboards and results (read-only)
- Can access events via direct link (for semi-private events)
- Cannot enter scores or join competitions

## Score display rules
Scoring display has the following rules

- -1 in score array means player gave up and should generally show as a dash "-"
- 0 means there is nothing reported yet and should show as a 0 (not NR)
- Any number above 0 is an actual score and should be shown as the number and number should be used in calculations

If there is ever a -1 then you don't really have a score for that hole, for the 9 holes where it appears and for the 18 holes so if there is a -1 then we should show "-" in leaderboards, team results etc

# TapScore Series Detail - Mobile-First Redesign Proposal (Revised)

## 🎯 Current Issues Identified

### Problems with Current Design:
1. **Tab overflow**: Horizontal scrolling tabs break mobile UX
2. **Poor header hierarchy**: Header doesn't follow TapScore design system
3. **Inconsistent with Competition Detail**: Different interaction patterns
4. **Missing visual hierarchy**: No clear content prioritization
5. **Outdated color scheme**: Not using TapScore brand colors

### Comparison with Competition Detail:
- ✅ Competition Detail: Clean header, proper tab navigation, consistent styling
- ❌ Series Detail: Cluttered header, scrolling tabs, inconsistent branding

## 📱 Mobile-First Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoint Strategy
\`\`\`css
/* Mobile First (default) */
.container { 
  padding: 1rem; 
  max-width: 100%;
}

.quick-access-grid {
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  gap: 1rem;
}

/* Tablet (768px+) */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .container { 
    padding: 1.5rem; 
    max-width: 768px;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
  
  .quick-access-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
    gap: 1.5rem;
  }
  
  .series-title {
    font-size: 3rem;
  }
}

/* Desktop (1024px+) */
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .container { 
    padding: 2rem;
    max-width: 1024px;
  }
  
  .hero-section {
    height: 300px;
  }
  
  .info-bar {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 1fr);
  }
}
\`\`\`

### Touch Optimization
- **Minimum Touch Targets**: 44px for all interactive elements

## ✅ Accessibility Guidelines

### Color Contrast
- **Text on Light Backgrounds**: Minimum 4.5:1 ratio (Charcoal Text on Scorecard White: 16.75:1 ✓)
- **Text on Dark Backgrounds**: Minimum 4.5:1 ratio (Scorecard White on Fairway Green: 13.94:1 ✓)
- **Interactive Elements**: Minimum 3:1 ratio for borders and focus indicators

### Focus Indicators
- All interactive elements must have visible focus indicators
- Focus indicators should be 2px minimum thickness
- Use contrasting colors (Sunset Coral on light, Scorecard White on dark)

### Typography
- Minimum 16px (1rem) for body text
- Maximum line length of 70 characters
- Sufficient line spacing (1.5 minimum for body text)

# Golf Serie Frontend - Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy the Golf Serie frontend application behind a reverse proxy.

## Overview

The application is configured to work in both development and production environments:

- **Development**: Uses Vite proxy to forward `/api` requests to `localhost:3000`
- **Production**: Dynamically detects the deployment path and adjusts API calls accordingly

## Deployment Configurations

### 1. Production Build for Reverse Proxy

The application is configured to be deployed under the `/golf-serie` path. When you run:

\`\`\`bash
npm run build
\`\`\`

The built files will have the correct base path (`/golf-serie/`) for:
- Static assets (CSS, JS, images)
- API requests

### 2. Generated Assets

After building, the `dist/index.html` will contain:
\`\`\`html
<script type="module" crossorigin src="/golf-serie/assets/index-[hash].js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" crossorigin href="/golf-serie/assets/index-[hash].css">
\`\`\`

### 3. API Request Handling

The application uses a smart API configuration that adapts to the deployment environment:

- **Development**: API calls go to `/api` (proxied by Vite)
- **Production under `/golf-serie`**: API calls go to `/golf-serie/api`
- **Production at root**: API calls go to `/api`

## Reverse Proxy Configuration

### Nginx Example

\`\`\`nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    # Serve the frontend under /golf-serie
    location /golf-serie/ {
        alias /path/to/your/dist/;
        try_files $uri $uri/ /golf-serie/index.html;
        
        # Handle SPA routing
        location ~* \.(js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|svg)$ {
            expires 1y;
            add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
        }
    }

    # Proxy API requests
    location /golf-serie/api/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/api/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
\`\`\`

### Apache Example

\`\`\`apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName your-domain.com
    DocumentRoot /path/to/your/dist

    # Serve the frontend under /golf-serie
    Alias /golf-serie /path/to/your/dist
    <Directory "/path/to/your/dist">
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
        
        # Handle SPA routing
        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteBase /golf-serie/
        RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
        RewriteRule . /golf-serie/index.html [L]
    </Directory>

    # Proxy API requests
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyPass /golf-serie/api/ http://localhost:3000/api/
    ProxyPassReverse /golf-serie/api/ http://localhost:3000/api/
</VirtualHost>
\`\`\`

## Testing the Deployment

### Local Testing

1. Build the application:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run build
   \`\`\`

2. Test the production build locally:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run preview:prod
   \`\`\`
   This will serve the app at `http://localhost:4173/golf-serie/`

### Backend Requirements

Ensure your backend API server:
1. Is running on the expected port (default: 3000)
2. Handles CORS properly for your domain
3. Serves API endpoints under `/api/`

## Environment-Specific Configuration

The application automatically detects its deployment context:

- **`import.meta.env.DEV`**: Development mode (uses Vite proxy)
- **Production**: Checks `window.location.pathname` to determine the base path

### Key Files

1. **`vite.config.ts`**: Sets build-time base path
2. **`src/api/config.ts`**: Runtime API URL detection and base path utilities
3. **`src/router.tsx`**: TanStack Router configuration with dynamic base path
4. **All API files**: Use shared `API_BASE_URL` configuration

## What's Fixed

The application now correctly handles:

1. **Static Assets**: Build artifacts (JS/CSS) use correct paths with `/golf-serie/` prefix
2. **API Requests**: Dynamically adapt to deployment context (dev vs prod, root vs sub-path)
3. **Client-Side Routing**: TanStack Router uses correct base path for route resolution
4. **SPA Navigation**: Direct URL access and browser refresh work correctly
5. **Redirects**: Index route redirects work with base path

## Troubleshooting

### Asset Loading Issues
- Verify the reverse proxy serves static files correctly
- Check that the base path in `vite.config.ts` matches your deployment path

### API Request Issues
- Ensure the backend is accessible at the expected URL
- Check reverse proxy configuration for API endpoint forwarding
- Verify CORS settings on the backend

### SPA Routing Issues
- Configure the web server to serve `index.html` for all unmatched routes
- Ensure the base path is correctly configured in your router

## Alternative Deployment Paths

To deploy under a different path (e.g., `/my-golf-app/`):

1. Update `vite.config.ts`:
   \`\`\`typescript
   const base = mode === 'production' ? '/my-golf-app/' : '/';
   \`\`\`

2. Update `src/api/config.ts`:
   \`\`\`typescript
   if (currentPath.startsWith('/my-golf-app')) {
     return '/my-golf-app/api';
   }
   \`\`\`

3. Update your reverse proxy configuration accordingly.

## Root Deployment

To deploy at the root path (`/`):

1. Update `vite.config.ts`:
   \`\`\`typescript
   const base = '/'; // Same for both dev and prod
   \`\`\`

2. The API configuration will automatically use `/api` for root deployments.

# Participant Assignment - Quick Start Guide

## Getting Started

This guide will walk you through using the Participant Assignment interface to organize golf competition participants into tee times.

## Prerequisites

Before you can assign participants, you need:

1. ✅ **Teams selected** for the competition
2. ✅ **Participant types defined** (e.g., "Singel 1", "Singel 2", "Bästboll 1")
3. ✅ **Tee times created** for the competition day

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Generate All Participants

1. Click the **"Generate All Participants"** button
2. This creates all combinations of your selected teams × participant types
3. Example: 4 teams × 3 types = 12 participants total

### Step 2: Assign Participants to Tee Times

You have two ways to assign participants:

#### Method A: Drag and Drop
1. **Drag** a participant from the left panel (Available Participants)
2. **Drop** it onto a tee time in the right panel
3. The participant moves from "available" to "assigned"

#### Method B: Click to Assign
1. Click **"+ Add participant"** button in any tee time
2. Select a participant from the popup dialog
3. Click **"Assign"** to confirm

### Step 3: Manage Assignments

- **Remove assignment**: Click the **×** button next to any assigned participant
- **View progress**: Check the statistics at the top (Total, Assigned, Remaining)
- **Track status**: See which participants are assigned in the left panel

## Tips & Best Practices

### Efficient Assignment
- **Start with popular types**: Assign common participant types first
- **Balance tee times**: Try to distribute participants evenly across tee times
- **Use drag and drop**: Faster for multiple assignments

### Visual Cues
- **Green checkmark** = Participant is assigned
- **Empty checkbox** = Participant available to assign
- **Green background** = Assigned participant in tee time
- **Blue highlight** = Valid drop zone during drag

### Error Prevention
- You cannot assign the same participant twice
- Already assigned participants are grayed out and cannot be dragged
- The system prevents invalid assignments automatically

## Common Workflows

### Scenario 1: Quick Assignment
\`\`\`
1. Generate participants → 2. Drag and drop all → 3. Done!
\`\`\`

### Scenario 2: Careful Planning
\`\`\`
1. Generate participants → 2. Use click-to-assign → 3. Review statistics → 4. Adjust as needed
\`\`\`

### Scenario 3: Partial Assignment
\`\`\`
1. Generate participants → 2. Assign some now → 3. Come back later → 4. Continue from where you left off
\`\`\`

## Troubleshooting

**Q: I can't drag a participant**
- ✅ Check if it's already assigned (look for green checkmark)

**Q: The drop didn't work**
- ✅ Make sure you're dropping in the tee time area (watch for blue highlight)

**Q: Participants didn't generate**
- ✅ Ensure you have teams selected and participant types defined

**Q: Assignment failed**
- ✅ Check your internet connection and try again

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Tab**: Navigate between interactive elements
- **Enter**: Activate buttons and selections
- **Escape**: Close dialogs and cancel operations

## Mobile Usage

On mobile devices:
- Drag and drop works with touch gestures
- Use the "Add participant" buttons for easier assignment
- Panels stack vertically for better viewing

## Next Steps

After assigning all participants:
1. Review the final assignments
2. Save/export if needed
3. Proceed with your golf competition setup

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes (Update 2)

**Bottom Sheet Flickering Issue - RESOLVED**
- ✅ **Root Cause**: Immediate render function calls in useCallback dependencies
- ✅ **Solution**: Changed to string-based content type system
- ✅ **Result**: Bottom sheets now open and stay open properly

**Back Navigation Issue - RESOLVED**  
- ✅ **Root Cause**: Incorrect implementation using direct navigation instead of browser history
- ✅ **Solution**: Restored proper `window.history.back()` for true browser back behavior
- ✅ **Result**: Proper single-step browser history navigation (series→competition→back to series)

**Implementation Changes:**
\`\`\`typescript
// Before: Problematic immediate render calls
bottomSheet.openSheet(renderDocumentsSheet(), "Documents");

// After: String-based content type
bottomSheet.openSheet("documents", "Documents");

// Before: Incorrect direct navigation
navigate({ to: "/player/series" });

// After: Proper browser history navigation  
window.history.back();
\`\`\`

**Development Server**: Ready for testing at `http://localhost:5174`

# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type-aware lint rules:

\`\`\`js
export default tseslint.config({
  extends: [
    // Remove ...tseslint.configs.recommended and replace with this
    ...tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked,
    // Alternatively, use this for stricter rules
    ...tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked,
    // Optionally, add this for stylistic rules
    ...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked,
  ],
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
})
\`\`\`

You can also install [eslint-plugin-react-x](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-x) and [eslint-plugin-react-dom](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-dom) for React-specific lint rules:

\`\`\`js
// eslint.config.js
import reactX from 'eslint-plugin-react-x'
import reactDom from 'eslint-plugin-react-dom'

export default tseslint.config({
  plugins: {
    // Add the react-x and react-dom plugins
    'react-x': reactX,
    'react-dom': reactDom,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable its recommended typescript rules
    ...reactX.configs['recommended-typescript'].rules,
    ...reactDom.configs.recommended.rules,
  },
})
\`\`\`

# Golf Series Backend

A simple backend system for managing golf courses, teams, and competitions.

## Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Bun.js
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Database**: SQLite3 using Bun's built-in SQLite library
- **HTTP Server**: Bun's built-in HTTP server
- **Testing**: Bun's built-in test runner

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your system

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   \`\`\`bash
   bun install
   \`\`\`
3. Run database migrations:
   \`\`\`bash
   bun run migrate
   \`\`\`

## Development

Start the development server:
\`\`\`bash
bun run dev
\`\`\`

The server will start on port 3000 by default. You can change this by setting the `PORT` environment variable.

## Testing

Run the test suite:
\`\`\`bash
bun test
\`\`\`

## API Endpoints

### Courses

- `POST /api/courses` - Create a course
- `GET /api/courses` - List all courses
- `GET /api/courses/:id` - Get single course
- `PUT /api/courses/:id` - Update a course

### Teams

- `POST /api/teams` - Create a team
- `GET /api/teams` - List all teams
- `GET /api/teams/:id` - Get single team
- `PUT /api/teams/:id` - Update team name

### Competitions

- `POST /api/competitions` - Create a competition
- `GET /api/competitions` - List all competitions
- `GET /api/competitions/:id` - Get single competition
- `PUT /api/competitions/:id` - Update a competition

## Data Models

### Course
- id (integer, primary key)
- name (text)
- pars (JSON array of 18 numbers)
- created_at, updated_at (datetime)

### Team
- id (integer, primary key)
- name (text, unique)
- created_at, updated_at (datetime)

### Competition
- id (integer, primary key)
- name (text)
- date (text/date)
- course_id (foreign key to Course)
- created_at, updated_at (datetime)

## Validation Rules

### Course
- Name is required and non-empty
- Pars must be array of exactly 18 positive integers (3-6 range)

### Team
- Name is required and non-empty
- Name must be unique

### Competition
- Name is required and non-empty
- Date is required (basic date format)
- course_id must reference existing course
