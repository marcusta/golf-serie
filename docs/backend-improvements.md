# Backend Improvement Proposals

This document outlines potential improvements for the backend of the Golf Series application.

## 1. Refactor Routing

**Problem**: The `src/app.ts` file is becoming large and contains all the route definitions for the entire application. This makes it difficult to navigate and maintain.

**Proposal**: Refactor the routing to be more modular. Each API file in `src/api` should be responsible for defining its own routes. The `src/app.ts` file would then import and register these routes.

**Example**:

```typescript
// src/api/competitions.ts
import { Hono } from 'hono';
import { CompetitionService } from '../services/competition-service';

export function createCompetitionsApi(competitionService: CompetitionService) {
  const competitionsApi = new Hono();

  competitionsApi.post('/', async (c) => {
    // ... create competition logic
  });

  competitionsApi.get('/', async (c) => {
    // ... find all competitions logic
  });

  // ... other routes

  return competitionsApi;
}

// src/app.ts
// ...
const competitionsApi = createCompetitionsApi(competitionService);
app.route('/api/competitions', competitionsApi);
// ...
```

## 2. Implement Robust Error Handling and Validation

**Problem**: The current error handling is basic. It catches errors in the API layer and returns a generic 500 error. The validation is also minimal and spread across the services.

**Proposal**: Implement a more robust error handling and validation strategy.

-   **Custom Error Classes**: Create custom error classes (e.g., `NotFoundError`, `ValidationError`) to represent different types of errors.
-   **Error Handling Middleware**: Create a Hono middleware to handle errors in a centralized way. This middleware would catch the custom errors and return the appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
-   **Validation Library**: Use a validation library like [Zod](https://zod.dev/) to define and enforce validation schemas for request bodies. This would centralize the validation logic and make it more declarative.

## 3. Add Authentication and Authorization

**Problem**: The API is currently public and does not have any authentication or authorization mechanisms.

**Proposal**: Implement authentication and authorization to secure the API.

-   **Authentication**: Use a library like [hono/jwt](https://hono.dev/middlewares/jwt) to implement JSON Web Token (JWT) based authentication.
-   **Authorization**: Implement a role-based access control (RBAC) system to restrict access to certain endpoints based on the user's role (e.g., admin, user).

## 4. Improve Build and Deployment Process

**Problem**: The current build and deployment process is not well-defined in the backend scripts.

**Proposal**: Improve the build and deployment process.

-   **Production Build**: Add a `build` script to the `package.json` that compiles the TypeScript code to JavaScript.
-   **Dockerization**: Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the application. This would make it easier to deploy the application in a consistent and reproducible way.
-   **Environment Variables**: Use a library like `dotenv` to manage environment variables for different environments (development, production).

## 5. Enhance Logging and Monitoring

**Problem**: The current logging is limited to `console.log` statements.

**Proposal**: Implement a more comprehensive logging and monitoring solution.

-   **Logging Library**: Use a logging library like [Pino](https://getpino.io/) to log structured JSON data. This would make it easier to search and analyze the logs.
-   **Monitoring**: Integrate a monitoring tool like [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) to collect metrics about the application's performance.
-   **Health Check Endpoint**: Add a `/health` endpoint that checks the status of the database connection and other dependencies.
