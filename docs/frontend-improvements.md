# Frontend Improvement Proposals

This document outlines potential improvements for the frontend of the Golf Series application.

## 1. Comprehensive Testing Strategy

**Problem**: The frontend currently has some end-to-end tests with Playwright, but it lacks a comprehensive testing strategy that includes unit and integration tests.

**Proposal**: Implement a more robust testing strategy.

-   **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for individual components and utility functions using a testing library like [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).
-   **Integration Tests**: Write integration tests to verify that different parts of the application work together as expected.
-   **Code Coverage**: Set up code coverage reporting to track the percentage of code that is covered by tests.

## 2. Enhance Component Library and Design System

**Problem**: The component library is growing, but it could benefit from better organization and documentation.

**Proposal**: Enhance the component library and create a design system.

-   **Component Documentation**: Use a tool like [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to create a living style guide for the component library. This would make it easier for developers to discover and use the existing components.
-   **Design Tokens**: Define a set of design tokens (e.g., colors, fonts, spacing) that can be shared between the design and development teams. This would ensure consistency across the application.
-   **Accessibility**: Improve the accessibility of the components by following the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) authoring practices.

## 3. Optimize Build and Deployment Process

**Problem**: The current build and deployment process is functional, but it could be optimized for better performance and reliability.

**Proposal**: Optimize the build and deployment process.

-   **Code Splitting**: Use Vite's code splitting features to split the application into smaller chunks. This would improve the initial load time of the application.
-   **Tree Shaking**: Ensure that tree shaking is properly configured to remove unused code from the final bundle.
-   **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the testing, building, and deployment of the application.

## 4. Performance Optimization

**Problem**: The application's performance is generally good, but there are areas where it could be improved.

**Proposal**: Implement performance optimization techniques.

-   **Memoization**: Use `React.memo` and `useMemo` to memoize components and expensive calculations.
-   **Virtualization**: Use a library like [TanStack Virtual](https://tanstack.com/virtual/latest) to render large lists of data more efficiently.
-   **Image Optimization**: Optimize the images by compressing them and using modern image formats like WebP.
